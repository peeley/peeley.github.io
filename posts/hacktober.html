                <h1>HacktoberFest 2019</h1>
                <hr/>
                <section>
                <p>
                Every year for the past few years, I've wanted to participate
                in Digital Ocean's annual HacktoberFest competition. If you
                haven't heard of it, DigitalOcean annually hosts a
                challenge wherein programmers make contributions to open
                source software during the month of October. All that's
                required of participants is to make a few pull requests (this
                year four were required) to public GitHub repositories and have
                the pull requests be verified to not be spam or
                counterproductive to maintainers.
                </p>
                <p>
                Overall, it's a great way to introduce people new
                to open source or programming in general to the open source
                community. Although I've been a huge supporter of the open
                source philosophy and a competent programmer for the better 
                part of a decade now, I had never gotten around to 
                participating before.
                Nearly ever year for the past three or four years, I would sign
                up for the challenge and school or life would get in the way,
                or I would be excited to start but be completely lost on what
                projects to contribute to. This year, however, was the
                exception - I finally participated in and completed the
                HacktoberFest challenge. Here are some of the projects I worked
                on, along with the work I did.

                <h3>Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead</h3>
                <p>
                Although I don't play video games nearly as much as I did as a
                kid, from time to time I do enjoy a good roguelike. Cataclysm:
                Dark Days Ahead (CDDA) is exactly that - an open-world roguelike
                set in a zombie apocalypse with a level of complexity only
                comparable to Dwarf Fortress or NetHack. Along with the usual
                roguelike features of turn-based combat, tileset/ASCII
                graphics, randomly-generated content, and permadeath, the game
                features an crafting system with hundreds of recipes and items.
                </p>
                <p>
                Two of my pull requests came from fixing bugs within the
                crafting system. All items and recipes are stored as JSON files
                within a folder in the repository, and as such bug fixes
                regarding item requirements or balance tweaks are super easy -
                compiling and testing the game isn't even necessary to validate
                the PR, just a JSON formatting check through TravisCI. My 
                <a href="https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/34503">
                first</a> pull request fixed a bug wherein the BB gun item was
                incorrectly labeled with an item property called "FOULING".
                Essentially, to balance gunpowder firearms in-game, the
                developers added the FOULING item flag; all FOULING items have
                their durability reduced after repeated shots, representing the
                gunpowder residue wearing out the rifling or barrel of the
                firearms. A BB gun obviously doesn't use gunpowder, so the bug
                fix was simple enough - remove the FOULING flag from the BB gun
                item JSON.
                </p>
                <p>
                My 
                <a href=https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/34696">
                second</a> pull request was similar. Items can also have item
                group labels, which simplify random content generation, e.g. 
                instead of listing every item that could possibly spawn in a 
                gun store, just allow items with the group label "gunstore" to 
                spawn in gunstores. If an item does not belong to any item
                group, though, it doesn't spawn in any location unless it is
                explicitly and individually added. This is what was happening
                to the "v6_diesel" item - because V6 diesel engines didn't
                actually belong to any item group, it never spawned in game.
                All I did to fix this was add it to the appropriate itemgroups,
                like "road" and "supplies_mechanics" to allow it to spawn on
                vehicles along roads and in mechanic shops.

                <h3>Servant</h3>
                <p>
                I've been using Haskell as one of my primary side-project
                languages for about a year now. After discovering it and
                going through the fantastic <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">
                Learn You a Haskell For Great Good</a> book to get the 
                basics down, I decided to see how the support was for web 
                development. I came across a framework named
                Servant, which seemed attractive with its similarities to the
                Flask framework I had experience with in Python. Both are
                fairly minimal framework that are more intended for backend
                API servers, rather than huge, opinionated, batteries-included 
                frameworks like Django in Python or Yesod for Haskell.
                </p>
                <p>
                As I'd used Servant for a couple months by the time the start
                of the challenge came around, I felt like it was time to give
                back to the project. I looked around the issues, but most that
                I could find were a couple months old or were super advanced
                type-level Haskell magic that I still haven't gotten around to
                learning. Some of the issues were related to documentation, so
                I thought I'd give them a try. The 
                <a href="https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1234">
                pull request</a> I did manage to get done was simply fixing the 
                broken links in the tutorial documentation.

                <h3>Hy</h3>
                <p>
                Everytime I see someone talk about Lisp on the Internet or in a
                computer science class, they always liken it to a
                <a href="https://www.xkcd.com/224/">
                mind-expanding psychedelic experience</a>. Unfortunately, 
                I'd never gotten an excuse to fully dive into Lisp any 
                deeper than the basic introduction to Scheme during a chapter
                of my programming languages class. When I found Hy, however, I
                found a great excuse to get into Lisp. Hy is a Lisp dialect
                that is based on the Python interpreter, similar to Clojure
                using the JVM. As a programming language nerd, I always find
                myself wanting to learn a new interesting language, but
                constantly having to resist sinking time into an obscure
                technology that might not pay off in any meaningful way. 
                Hy is different in that it's totally interoperable with 
                Python and Python packages, so Hy already benefits from the 
                huge and high-quality Python ecosystem.
                </p>
                <p>
                My contribution to Hy was the first 
                <a href="https://github.com/hylang/hy/pull/1826">pull request
                </a> I made that wasn't based on an issue listed on GitHub. 
                When I was going through the quickstart for Hy, I noticed that 
                the help message in the <code>hy</code> interpreter was 
                identical to that in the vanilla Python interpreter. This was a
                bug, since the default help message "<code>Type help() for
                interactive help, or help(object) for help about object.</code>"
                doesn't show the actual help command which used the Lisp-like 
                syntax <code>(help)</code>. 
                For the first time in the challenge, I had to actually dive into 
                the code in the repository and check out the guts of the 
                interpreter. Fortunately, <code>grep</code>ing for the help
                message took me directly to the culprit, and all that was
                necessary to fix the bug was to create a new Python object to
                override the default Python help object. Unfortunately, the
                <code>(help)</code> function still uses the default PyDoc help
                system which prints "<code>Welcome to Python 3.7's help 
                utility!</code>. Changing the "Python 3.7" to "Hy (version
                number)" would require a rewrite of the PyDoc module, which
                seemed a little unnecessarily intensive. I might come back to
                change this since it is aesthetically displeasing and
                communicates an over-reliance on Python tooling, but for now I
                think it'll serve it's purpose well enough.

                <h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                As I expected, participating in HacktoberFest was a blast. As
                much as I love working on my personal side projects, getting
                the feeling of "Is this a valuable use of my time and skills?" 
                every so often is kind of a downer. With open source projects 
                (at least the popular ones), I can see my own name pop up as a 
                contributor to software that I and thousands of others use and 
                enjoy. 
                </p>
                <p>
                This was also an interesting look at the process of
                entering the open-source community. Even though there are 
                <a href="https://up-for-grabs.net/#/">tons</a>
                <a href="http://github-help-wanted.com/">of</a> 
                <a href="https://www.firsttimersonly.com/">sites</a>
                catered to people who want to find a cool project with
                some low-hanging possible contributions, I didn't find
                any of them particularly useful. Not only do these sites not
                really describe the project beyond giving a link to a GitHub 
                repository, I simply didn't feel interested in
                spending time on any of the projects I saw. I ended up 
                contributing to the projects I did because I was familiar with 
                them and also had a vested interest in their success. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Another thing I found pretty unhelpful was the 
                "good for beginners" tag for issues on GitHub. All the "good
                for beginners" issues I saw on repositories were weeks to months
                old and had been fruitlessly picked over by a few hopeful
                contributors by the time that I looked at them. The actual easy
                and beginner-friendly issues had just been
                posted within the same day and were still unlabeled and
                unclaimed. There seems to be a sort of <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">survivorship
                bias</a> at work 
                here - as contributors infrequently label issues, all the
                issues that are truly "good for beginners" are fixed by the
                time that contributors get around to labeling, so the
                issues that are labeled such are really of medium difficulty
                or higher. Seeing a pretty tough or involved issue labeled as
                "good for beginners" is intimidating and certainly made me
                question my abilities, which further factors into the difficulty
                of getting people involved as contributors to open source 
                software. So if any open source maintainers are reading, here's
                my two cents: try to label issues more frequently, or change
                the labeling to reflect more difficulty than anticipated after
                a few people have unsuccessfully taken a crack at fixing the
                issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                Overall, HacktoberFest 2019 was a great experience. I branched
                out into some technologies I wouldn't have expected, got some
                real experience on working with widely-used software, and can
                now call myself an open-source contributor. I know it's just a
                stupid T-shirt, but I'm sure once my HacktoberFest shirt comes
                in the mail I'll wear it proudly.
